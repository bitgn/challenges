# Hubs Program Guide (Host a BitGN PAC Hub)
**BitGN Agent Challenge: Personal & Trustworthy** (BitGN PAC)  
**Audience:** community organizers, local partners  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last updated:** 19 Feb 2026 (Vienna time)

## What a hub is
A hub is a local in-person gathering synchronized with the global BitGN PAC event. Vienna is listed as the top “HQ hub” by default because the organizer is based in Vienna, but hubs can exist worldwide.

## What BitGN provides to hubs
- hub listing on the BitGN platform (after approval)
- hub code / QR attribution for local leaderboards
- local leaderboard view
- promo kit (logos, suggested copy, suggested agenda)
- livestream embed materials

## What hubs must provide
- venue and capacity
- organizer contact
- schedule and hub registration link
- local logistics and safety readiness
- optional local sponsors and prizes (hub-managed)

## Approval process (listing review)
Hubs submit a listing via a form on bitgn.com (enabled as rollout progresses). BitGN reviews for completeness and non-negotiables.

Target review time: ~3 business days (best effort).

## Non-negotiables
To be listed as an official BitGN PAC Hub, you must agree to:
- enforce Code of Conduct
- non-discrimination
- safety and legality
- **no charging participants for competition participation**

## Data boundary
BitGN does not share platform registration data with hubs. Hubs manage their own attendee lists and recruiting processes independently.

## Liability boundary
BitGN provides the platform and hub listing. Hub events are the hub organizers’ responsibility.

## Branding rules
Use: **“BitGN PAC Hub in <City>”**  
Do not imply global sponsorship by BitGN.

## Sponsor neutrality
Hub sponsors may be visible on hub-controlled pages/materials, but do not receive visibility on the global BitGN platform.
