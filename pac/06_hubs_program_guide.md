# Host a BitGN PAC Hub (Hubs Program Guide)
**BitGN Agent Challenge: Personal & Trustworthy** (BitGN PAC)  
**Audience:** community organizers, local partners  
**Version:** 1.1  
**Last updated:** 26 Feb 2026 (Vienna time)


## What a hub is
A hub is a local, in-person meetup for people participating in the BitGN PAC competition. 

BitGN runs as a global online challenge. In parallel, communities can self-organize local on-site hubs (cafés, coworking spaces, universities) to collaborate in person while participating in the same global event. 

Everyone still competes in the same global event and submits to the same leaderboard. The hub just gives people in your city a place to build together. Local hub leaderboards are also available.

Vienna is listed as the “HQ hub” simply because the organizer is based there. Hubs can happen anywhere.

## What BitGN provides to hubs
- a public hub listing on the BitGN website (approval-based: only approved hubs are shown)
- a hub page you can manage and update
- a hub check-in code / QR for on-site attribution (assigned closer to competition day)
- a local leaderboard view (available on competition day, global + your hub), based on check-ins

## What hubs must provide
- venue and capacity
- organizer contact
- hub URL and venue size details
- local logistics and safety readiness
- optional local sponsors and prizes (hub-managed)

## How to propose a hub (step by step)
1. Log into BitGN and go to your profile page.
2. Add a city where you want to host a hub.
3. Click “I want to host a hub”.
4. Fill in the hub form:
- hub name
- hub link where you accept registrations 
- venue size (example: “10–20 people”)
- optional hub description
- confirm the required rules
5. Submit. You can come back later to edit your proposal.

## What happens after you submit
- Your hub starts as pending (BitGN reviews it).
- If approved, it becomes public on the BitGN site.
- People, who have tagged the venue city as city of interest, will see your hub link in their profiles.
- If you edit an approved hub later, BitGN reviews the changes, and the public page keeps showing the last approved version until the update is approved.

## Non-negotiables
To be listed as an official BitGN PAC Hub, you must agree to:
- enforce Code of Conduct
- non-discrimination
- safety and legality
- **no charging participants for competition participation** - Optional venue cost-sharing for food/drinks/etc. is fine, but competition participation must be free.

## Data boundary
BitGN does not share platform registration data with hubs. Hubs manage their own attendee lists and recruiting processes independently.

## Responsibility and liability
BitGN provides the platform and hub listing. Your hub event is your responsibility as the local organizer. This includes handling on-site incidents and escalating Code of Conduct reports when needed.

## Naming and branding
Use the format: “BitGN PAC1 Hub in <City>”
Please don’t present your hub as globally sponsored or “officially hosted” by BitGN beyond providing a venue for participation.

## Local prizes (optional)
Hubs may offer local prizes for hub participants or local winners (hub-managed). Any local prizes or sponsors are not sponsorship of the global BitGN challenge and should be clearly presented as hub-local only.

## Sponsor neutrality
Local sponsors can be shown on hub-controlled materials/pages, but they do not get promotion on the global BitGN platform.

## Hub attribution (on-site check-in)
At the hub on the day of the Challenge participants check in by entering your hub code or scanning your hub QR. Participants can appear on multiple leaderboards (global + your hub).
