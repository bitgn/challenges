# Hubs Program Guide (Host a BitGN PAC Hub)
**BitGN Agent Challenge: Personal & Trustworthy** (BitGN PAC)  
**Audience:** community organizers, local partners  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last updated:** 20 Feb 2026 (Vienna time)

## What a hub is
A hub is a local in-person gathering synchronized with the global BitGN PAC event. Vienna is listed as the top “HQ hub” by default because the organizer is based in Vienna, but hubs can exist worldwide.

## What BitGN provides to hubs
- in-platform proposal flow from `/me` and city interests
- hub management pages: `/me/hubs/new` and `/me/hubs`
- approval-gated hub listing on the BitGN platform
- revisioned listings (approved listing remains public while edits are pending)
- hub code/QR for on-site check-in attribution
- local leaderboard view

## What hubs must provide
- venue and capacity
- organizer contact
- hub URL and venue size details
- local logistics and safety readiness
- optional local sponsors and prizes (hub-managed)

## Hub proposal flow on BitGN platform
Host proposals are submitted and managed inside BitGN:
1) Open `/me`.
2) On an interested city row, click **“I want to host a hub”**.
3) Complete `/me/hubs/new?city_id=<id>` and submit:
   - `city_id` (must be one of your interested cities)
   - `event_slug` (from active events)
   - `hub_name`
   - `hub_url` (`http`/`https`)
   - `venue_size` (free text, e.g. `10-20`)
   - required compliance attestations (all checked)
4) Track and edit proposals in `/me/hubs`.

## Listing states in `/me/hubs`
- `pending`
- `approved`
- `changes_pending`
- `rejected`

## Approval and edit behavior
- Initial proposal creates a pending listing.
- First approval makes the listing public.
- Editing an approved hub creates a new pending revision.
- While edits are pending, public pages continue to show the last approved revision.
- If a pending edit is rejected, the approved public listing remains unchanged.

## Non-negotiables
To be listed as an official BitGN PAC Hub, you must agree to:
- enforce Code of Conduct
- non-discrimination
- safety and legality
- **no charging participants for competition participation**

## Data boundary
BitGN does not share platform registration data with hubs. Hubs manage their own attendee lists and recruiting processes independently.

## Liability boundary
BitGN provides the platform and hub listing. Hub events are the hub organizers’ responsibility.

## Branding rules
Use: **“BitGN PAC Hub in <City>”**  
Do not imply global sponsorship by BitGN.

## Sponsor neutrality
Hub sponsors may be visible on hub-controlled pages/materials, but do not receive visibility on the global BitGN platform.

## Hub attribution (on-site check-in)
Participants attribute to a hub by entering the hub code or scanning the hub QR at check-in. A participant may appear on multiple leaderboards (global + hub).
