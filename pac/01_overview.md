# BitGN PAC Overview
**BitGN Agent Challenge: Personal & Trustworthy** (BitGN PAC)  
**Audience:** everyone (first touch)  
**Version:** 1.1  
**Last updated:** 26 Feb 2026 (Vienna time)

## One-sentence promise
By the end, you’ll have built your own autonomous agent, validated it against an enterprise-grade benchmark, and discovered new engineering patterns that collectively advance the state of the art in trustworthy personal agents.

## What BitGN PAC is
BitGN PAC is a **benchmark + global competition** for building **personal and trustworthy autonomous agents**.

You write an agent, connect it to BitGN via API, and solve tasks inside a **deterministic simulated environment**. BitGN evaluates outcomes by observing tool calls and side effects (not by grading prose).

## Who it’s for
- Solo builders
- Small teams and startups
- Researchers and applied ML/agent engineers
- Enterprise AI/R&D engineers
- Students and the broader “agents community”

## What you build
You build the **agentic core**:
- planning/control loop
- safe tool use
- reliability under ambiguity
- prompt-injection resistance and security posture
- protocol-compliant outputs required by tasks

BitGN provides the simulated world, tool APIs, tasks, and evaluation harness.

## Why “trustworthy”
“Trustworthy” is not marketing here — it is enforced by evaluation:
- reliability and correct outcomes
- safe tool use and controlled side effects
- prompt-injection resistance (especially via messages/docs)
- privacy/security posture (no secret exfiltration)
- determinism and evaluation rigor (reproducible scoring)

## Key dates and phases (Vienna time)
- **March 2026:** API access smoke test / minimal sandbox
- **At least two weeks before 11 Apr 2026:** full API + limited practice tasks
- **11 Apr 2026:** main event (blind scoring window)
- **Afterwards:** challenge continues with live feedback and ongoing runs

Exact competition window timing will be announced.

## Free + global/remote by default
Participation on the BitGN platform is free and remote-first.

Optional in-person **BitGN PAC Hubs** may be organized by local communities. Hubs are synchronized with the global event and manage their own venue/logistics/sponsors/prizes.

## Track record
A previous competition platform iteration (Enterprise RAG Challenge 3) scaled to:
- 525 registered teams
- 10,439 completed sessions
- 368,679 agent runs evaluated

**Community signal (as of 26 Feb 2026):** 340 engineers have pre-registered interest across 67 cities/locations.

## Get started (CTA)
Register → get an API key → run a sample agent → appear on the leaderboard.  
**Let’s learn and push the state of the art together.**
